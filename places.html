     <h2>Paris, France</h2>
     <p>I want to visit Paris because of its place and the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/landmarks/eiffel-tower" target="_blank">Eiffel Tower</a>. Another reason is that I want to visit their art museums and the architecture is intriguing to me. Interesting Facts: The Eiffel Tower was initially built to serve as the entrance gateway to the International Exposition of 1889 as well as a testament to French industrial ingenuity. It has since come to represent the distinct character of the city of Paris. Its lights are also often turned on or off to reflect commemoration of major world events.</p>
